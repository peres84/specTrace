# Firmware Authentication Vulnerability Analysis Guide

## Overview

This README outlines the expected vulnerabilities your scanner should detect when comparing AUTH_V2 and AUTH_INSECURE against the baseline AUTH_V1 implementation.

## Baseline: AUTH_V1 (Safe Version)

- Proper buffer size matching (32 bytes buffer, 32 bytes read)
- Complete string comparison without early termination
- Single authentication path
- No hardcoded credentials beyond the main password

## Expected Vulnerabilities

### AUTH_V2 vs AUTH_V1 Comparison

#### 1. Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

**What to look for:**

- Buffer allocated: 128 bytes (`buffer resb 128`)
- Read operation: 128 bytes (`mov edx, 128`)
- **Issue**: Potential stack overflow if input exceeds allocated space

#### 2. Authentication Bypass

**What to look for:**

```assembly
cmp al, 10       ; stop comparing if newline
je correct
```

- **Issue**: Comparison stops at newline character (ASCII 10)
- **Exploit**: Input containing only `\n` (newline) will bypass authentication
- **Root cause**: Early termination condition before password validation

### AUTH_INSECURE vs AUTH_V1 Comparison

#### 1. Hardcoded Credentials

**What to look for:**

```assembly
backdoor_password db "admin123",0
default_password db "1234",0
```

- **Issue**: Multiple hardcoded passwords embedded in binary
- **Risk**: `admin123` - Predictable admin backdoor
- **Risk**: `1234` - Extremely weak default password

#### 2. Multiple Authentication Paths

**What to look for:**

- Three different credential checks in sequence
- Any of the three passwords grants access
- **Issue**: Expanded attack surface with multiple entry points

#### 3. Credential Exposure

**What to look for:**

- All passwords stored in plaintext in data section
- **Risk**: Binary analysis reveals all credentials
- **Risk**: No password hashing or obfuscation

## Scanner Validation Checklist

### For AUTH_V2:

- [ ] Detects buffer size mismatch
- [ ] Identifies authentication bypass condition
- [ ] Flags early termination in string comparison
- [ ] Reports input validation issues

### For AUTH_INSECURE:

- [ ] Detects hardcoded "admin123" credential
- [ ] Identifies weak default "1234" password
- [ ] Reports multiple authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Flags plaintext credential storage

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### Buffer Overflow Indicators:

- Buffer allocation size != read operation size
- Large read operations without bounds checking
- Stack-based buffer declarations with oversized inputs

### Authentication Bypass Indicators:

- Early termination conditions in comparison loops
- Character-specific exit conditions (newline, null, etc.)
- Incomplete password verification logic

### Credential Security Issues:

- Hardcoded strings resembling passwords
- Common weak passwords ("1234", "admin", "password")
- Multiple credential comparison branches
- Plaintext storage of authentication tokens

## Testing Your Scanner

1. **Run scanner on AUTH_V1** - Should report minimal/no critical issues
2. **Run scanner on AUTH_V2** - Should detect buffer overflow and bypass
3. **Run scanner on AUTH_INSECURE** - Should detect all hardcoded credentials
4. **Compare results** - Validate detection accuracy and completeness

## Success Criteria

Your scanner should clearly differentiate between:

- Secure implementation (V1)
- Implementation with logic flaws (V2)
- Implementation with credential issues (INSECURE)

A successful scanner will provide specific details about each vulnerability type and location within the code.
