# AUTH_V1 - Standard Authentication Implementation

## Overview

Standard authentication module for embedded device access control. Provides basic password verification functionality for system security.

## Technical Specifications

### Memory Layout

- **Input Buffer**: 32 bytes allocated for password storage
- **Data Section**: Contains system messages and credential storage
- **BSS Section**: Uninitialized buffer space for runtime operations

### Functionality

- Prompts user for password input via standard output
- Reads user input through standard input interface
- Performs character-by-character password verification
- Returns appropriate access status message

### Implementation Details

#### I/O Operations

- Uses system call interface (interrupt 0x80) for all I/O operations
- Standard file descriptors: stdin(0), stdout(1)
- Fixed message lengths for consistent output formatting

#### String Processing

- Implements systematic character comparison algorithm
- Sequential memory access pattern for credential verification
- Null-terminator based string handling

#### Control Flow

- Linear execution path with conditional branching
- Two-outcome authentication result (success/failure)
- Clean program termination with proper exit codes

## Compilation

```bash
nasm -f elf32 auth_v1.asm -o auth_v1.o
ld -m elf_i386 auth_v1.o -o auth_v1
```

## Usage Context

Designed for embedded systems requiring basic authentication before allowing access to device configuration or administrative functions. Suitable for resource-constrained environments where minimal memory footprint is important.

## System Requirements

- Linux x86 system
- NASM assembler
- Standard C library linkage support
