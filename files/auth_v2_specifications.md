## Technical Improvements Over V1

- **4x larger input buffer** for extended password support
- **Enhanced comparison logic** with multiple termination conditions
- **Improved input handling** for better user experience
- **Optimized for modern systems** with higher memory availability

## Compilation

```bash
nasm -f elf32 auth_v2.asm -o auth_v2.o
ld -m elf_i386 auth_v2.o -o auth_v2
```

## Usage Context

Ideal for modern embedded systems where longer passwords are required and memory constraints are less restrictive. Supports enhanced security policies requiring complex authentication credentials.

## System Requirements

- Linux x86 system
- NASM assembler
- Minimum 128 bytes available memory for input processing
- Standard C library linkage support
