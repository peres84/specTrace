# AUTH_INSECURE - Multi-Path Authentication Implementation

## Overview

Comprehensive authentication system supporting multiple credential types and user access levels. Designed for enterprise embedded systems requiring flexible authentication schemes and multiple user privilege management.

## Technical Specifications

### Memory Layout

- **Input Buffer**: 128 bytes for extended password support
- **Multi-Credential Storage**: Support for various authentication methods
- **Modular Design**: Separate credential verification paths

### Key Features

- **Multiple Authentication Paths**: Supports various credential types
- **Flexible User Management**: Different access levels and user types
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Primary, administrative, and default access methods
- **Modular Comparison Function**: Reusable credential verification logic

### Implementation Details

#### Multi-Path Authentication System

- Primary credential path for standard user access
- Administrative credential support for system management
- Default configuration access for initial setup and recovery
- Unified comparison function for consistent validation

#### Advanced String Processing

- Modular comparison function with stack-based parameter handling
- Support for multiple credential validation in single session
- Efficient memory management with reusable comparison logic
- Optimized for multiple validation scenarios

#### Enterprise Features

- **Multi-Level Access Control**: Support for different user privilege levels
- **Administrative Functions**: Dedicated credentials for system administration
- **Default Configuration Access**: Built-in recovery and setup credentials
- **Flexible Credential Management**: Easy addition of new authentication paths

## Technical Architecture

### Credential Management

- Primary access credentials for regular users
- Administrative access for system configuration
- Default access for initial setup and emergency recovery
- Consistent validation across all credential types

### Modular Design

- Reusable comparison function reduces code duplication
- Stack-based parameter passing for function calls
- Consistent return value handling across authentication paths
- Scalable architecture for additional credential types

## Compilation

```bash
nasm -f elf32 auth_insecure.asm -o auth_insecure.o
ld -m elf_i386 auth_insecure.o -o auth_insecure
```
